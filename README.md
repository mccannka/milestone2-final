# Saving for your future #

## Overview ##

This Savings Calculator is an interactive calculator encouraging visitors to maximise their saving potential.  Following COVID consumers have been unable to spend their disposable income, there was an Â£186.1 billion increase in currency and deposits held by households in 2020 (Source:  Offince of National Statistics).

The purpose of the calculator is to ensure consumers are making the most of their savings, by ensuring they are getting the best rate in the financial market.  In addition the website will give consumers a personalised visualisation of what they could potentially earn if they changed the financial provider / account they had their savings in.  The data being used is fictional.

Also it will aim  to educate consumers on saving, the benefits and the alternative to saving.

## UX 

This is a single page application being protyped to understand if there is sufficient demand for this type of tool.  If there is, I'd look to develop further i.e. educating in relation to stock markets, utilising an API to bring in performace versus savings performance.  

Below are the wireframes completed to undertand the design of the single page across both desktop and mobile devices. Key was to ensure that the main information was accessible, irrespective of the device being used.

In designing the single page I was keen that it protrayed both a professional and progressive business, therefore I needed both the colour scheme and imagery to reflect that. Using coolors.co enabled me to select a neutral colour scheme and inturn design a brand logo which reflected that.

## User Stories 

* As a new user, I want to immediately find information on what support the website provides.
* As a new user, I want to immediately find information on what I need to complete the task I came for.
* As a new user, I want to see, within seconds, how the calculator will benefit me and the information it will provide.
* As a returning user, I want to get straight to using the calculator without interaction such as scrolling or clicking.
* As a returning user, I want to be able to provide feedback with regard to my needs/issues with the website.

## Strategy 

The website is for individuals who have savings, or who are thinking about saving, there are two personas specifically that are the focus for this prototype:

*  New to saving, but have a purpose for saving for example a deposit for a first home, typically aged 20-35.

*  Mature savers, who want to make the most of the return they get on their savings, typically aged 35+ with surplus income.

## Current Features 

Users can currently:

* Search for savings support via Google and see this page as a result.

* When they reach the page, they can provide information on what type of savings they are interested in i.e. short, medium or long term.

* Once they advise their savings preference they will then see the savings rates from the local market.

## Future Features 

Interest, timing & budget provided, this could be developed further to include:

* Confirming onscreeen how much they could save (or lose) from switching their savings.

* Sign posting how to apply for a savings account with one of the 4 providers.

* Include game functionality, aimed at teenagers to encourage a savings mindset.

(1) First Time User Goal:  First Time Visitors should understand the main purpose of the company.

Outcome:
* Navigation with key customer objectives 
* Key call to action is to calculate result

(2) Returning visitor User Goal:  To find out the latest rates that would benefit them and understand why they should change.

Outcome:
* This is an aspect which needs to be developed as the company becomes established.  Adding detailed blog content will not only benefit returning users, but would also support growth in SEO.


### Further Testing ###
* Tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* Viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

Testing done to ensure that links work correctly & design is correct across a range of devices.

## Deployment 

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1) Log in to GitHub (https://github.com/) and locate the GitHub Repository
2) At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3) Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4) Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5) The page will automatically refresh.
6) Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...
