# Savimg for your future #

## Overview ##

This Savings Calculator is an interactive calculator encouraging visitors to maximise their saving potential.  Following COVID consumers have been unable to spend their disposable income, there was an Â£186.1 billion increase in currency and deposits held by households in 2020 (Source:  Offince of National Statistics).

The purpose of the calculator is to ensure consumers are making the most of their savings, by ensuring they are getting the best rate in the financial market.  In addition the website will give consumers a personalised visualisation of what they could potentially earn if they changed the financial provider / account they had their savings in.  The data being used is fictional.

Also it will aim  to educate consumers on saving, the benefits and the alternative to saving.

## UX 

This is a single page application being protyped to understand if there is sufficient demand for this type of tool.  If there is, I'd look to develop further i.e. educating in relation to stock markets, utilising an API to bring in performace versus savings performance.  

Below are the wireframes completed to undertand the design of the single page across both desktop and mobile devices. Key was to ensure that the main information was accessible, irrespective of the device being used.

Desktop Design
Mobile Design

In designing the single page I was keen that it protrayed both a professional and progressive business, therefore I needed both the colour scheme and imagery to reflect that. Using coolors.co enabled me to select a neutral colour scheme and inturn design a brand logo which reflected that.
