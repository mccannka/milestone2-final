# Saving for your future #

## Overview ##

This Savings Calculator is an interactive calculator encouraging visitors to maximise their saving potential.  Following COVID consumers have been unable to spend their disposable income, there was an Â£186.1 billion increase in currency and deposits held by households in 2020 (Source:  Offince of National Statistics).

The purpose of the calculator is to ensure consumers are making the most of their savings, by ensuring they are getting the best rate in the financial market.  In addition the website will give consumers a personalised visualisation of what they could potentially earn if they changed the financial provider / account they had their savings in.  The data being used is fictional.

Also it will aim  to educate consumers on saving, the benefits and the alternative to saving.

## UX 

This is a single page application being protyped to understand if there is sufficient demand for this type of tool.  If there is, I'd look to develop further i.e. educating in relation to stock markets, utilising an API to bring in performace versus savings performance.  

Below are the wireframes completed to undertand the design of the single page across both desktop and mobile devices. Key was to ensure that the main information was accessible, irrespective of the device being used.

In designing the single page I was keen that it protrayed both a professional and progressive business, therefore I needed both the colour scheme and imagery to reflect that. Using coolors.co enabled me to select a neutral colour scheme and inturn design a brand logo which reflected that.

## User Stories 

As a new user, I want to immediately find information on what support the website provides.
As a new user, I want to immediately find information on what I need to complete the task I came for.
As a new user, I want to see, within seconds, how the calculator will benefit me and the information it will provide.
As a returning user, I want to get straight to using the calculator without interaction such as scrolling or clicking.
As a returning user, I want to be able to provide feedback with regard to my needs/issues with the website.

## Strategy 

The website is for individuals who have savings, or who are thinking about saving, there are two personas specifically that are the focus for this prototype:

*  New to saving, but have a purpose for saving for example a deposit for a first home, typically aged 20-35.

*  Mature savers, who want to make the most of the return they get on their savings, typically aged 35+ with surplus income.

If this prototype was a success the next phase would include adding game funcionality aimed at teenagers to encourage saving behaviours.

## Features for future implementation


## Testing & Deployment 

To ensure the site contains valid HTML, the code was checked directly using validator.w3.org.  No errors were returned.

<br>
CSS for the site has also been checked via https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator and no errors returned.
<br>
<br>
The site has also been checked using Google Lighthouse, summary can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/mccannka/fulltemplate/blob/master/google-lighthouse.png">here</a>, final output following suggested amends can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/mccannka/mccann-design/blob/master/google-lighthouse-final.png">here</a>.  Chrome Developer tools has also been used to test via a range of devices i.e. Iphone, macbook and Ipad.

1) First Time User Goal:  First Time Visitors should understand the main purpose of the company.

Outcome:
* Company logo 
* Navigation with key customer objectives 
* Key call to action is to get in contact

(2) Returning visitor User Goal:  To find out the latest trends that would benefit businesses to increase their online exposure.

Outcome:
* This is an aspect which needs to be developed as the company becomes established.  Adding detailed blog content will not only benefit returning users, but would also support growth in SEO.
Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.

### Further Testing ###
* Tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* Viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

Testing done to ensure that links work correctly & design is correct across a range of devices.
